# Universe Terminal (uTerm)
The **universe terminal**, or **uTerm**, is a terminal-based universe explorer that lets you navigate galaxies, explore cosmic directories and discover new knowledge, all from a custom command-line interface. 

**Try it now:** universeterminal.com

## Features
- Terminal-style interface inspired by Linux/UNIX systems
- AI-powered 
- Infinite, context-aware universe expansion
- Tab-autocomplete support
- Tree visualizer command

## How It Works
uTerm simulates a UNIX filesystem where each directory is a piece of the universe — from superclusters and nebulae to atoms and particles. As you explore using familiar terminal commands like ls, cd, and cat, uTerm dynamically generates content using Google’s Gemini API, creating a unique, infinite, AI-driven cosmos with every session.

- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, CORS, SlowAPI
- **AI:** Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)
